#submission form
I’m currently working on a submission form project with the aim of learning Vibe coding using Copilot AI in Visual Studio Code. 
I'm exploring how to access and utilize its features effectively. 
Copilot has been especially helpful for debugging and verifying that my code aligns with the project’s requirements. 
It also provided valuable suggestions to improve the project’s accessibility and animations. 
Thanks to its assistance, I was able to complete the project faster than when I worked on similar tasks alone.# submission-form
